      <p>Through techniques of hacking, manipulating, recycling, and reconfiguring, Cory Arcangel turns the intersection of technology and culture into materials for making art. He works in a range of mediums, from music, film, painting, and performance to video games, websites, and software, often relying on appropriation of pop cultural idioms, particularly those found online. Some of his best known works include his Photoshop Gradient Demonstrations, digital paintings made from the software’s ubiquitous templates; Super Mario Clouds (2002), for which he hacked the classic video game to remove everything but its sunny backdrop; and Drei Klavierstücke op.11 (2009), a version of Arnold Schönberg’s 1909 musical piece of the same name made from compiled YouTube clips of cats playing the piano. Arcangel is as forward-looking as he is nostalgic for obsolete technologies, and through his devotion to open-source code intends to further the cycle of appropriation he’s an integral part of and undermine the ideal of artistic originality. With his ironic touch and ability to mine the choicest bits of absurdity from the internet, Arcangel also freely admits that humor is a central concern of his practice.</p>
